Master is the first branch which consists of no flask, just the start of the calendar creation and set up nothing new.
New-feature is the complete website with a database creation script, flask implementation, and works as expected well tested but not ready for deployment
Deployment is the complete website and is integrated with flask however it uses sqlite which i will soon deploy with heroku and allow it to use postgresql.
this was my advanced web technologies project class was taugh by professor Simon Wells, in this class I learned how servers actually work how to deploy my websites, utalise APIS how to make API calls and requests, how to use mvc, Model view controller where all services, requests and arguments are handled by different functions ensuring the smooth functionality of this website I had failed to host it by the deadline at the end of the class however I did continue on with this project during the group project class taugh by Brian Davidson and Oluwaseun Bamgboye which was an oppurtunity which I am forver grateful for.
the tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating the templates and python (Flask Framework) for managing the back end.

Advanced Web Technologies Project – Calendar App
📌 Overview

A full-stack calendar web application built with Flask (Python), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Provides a calendar interface for scheduling and managing events.

Demonstrates use of APIs, MVC architecture, and server deployment.

Initially created as part of the Advanced Web Technologies module, later expanded with new features and deployment integration.

🌱 Branches

master → Initial setup with calendar creation (no Flask).

new-feature → Complete website with Flask integration and SQLite, includes database creation script and testing.

deployment → Full Flask app ready for deployment, currently using SQLite (soon to be upgraded to PostgreSQL on Heroku).

🛠️ Tech Stack
