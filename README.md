Master is the first branch which consists of no flask, just the start of the calendar creation and set up nothing new.
New-feature is the complete website with a database creation script, flask implementation, and works as expected well tested but not ready for deployment
Deployment is the complete website and is integrated with flask however it uses sqlite which i will soon deploy with heroku and allow it to use postgresql.
